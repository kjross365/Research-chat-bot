NOTE THAT THE DATABSE IS CURRENTLY LIMITED

1/11: Research bot is currently working as intended but the Database is very empty. I am going to be inputting thousands of searches within the next few hours to increase the size of the database

1/12: added over 1600 lines of "knowledge" using an auto searching program. The bot now has a less limited ammount of knowledge. still pretty limited but will be able to answer some questions without needing api keys. Each API and ID is limited to 100 free searches a day before either getting charged or shut down.
